### MVVM for ios
**UIKit implementation**
Following the udemy course "MVVM Design Pattern Using Swift in iOS" this repository contains all the example apps we went through to understand the concepts behind MVVM architecture.

The main focus of this course was to teach how to implement MVVM design pattern in a UIKit scope.
Here i got to learn about: 
- how to create bindings for views to viewmodels and viewmodels to views.
- How to create flows in UIKit by working extensively with UIViewControllers, TableViewControllers, Delegation pattern as well as seques.
- Using UserDefaults.
- Understanding Unit testing and refactoring.
